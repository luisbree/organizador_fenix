# **App Name**: Task Ranker

## Core Features:

- Task Input and Parsing: Input task details (description, urgency, necessity, cost, duration) via a single text field, parsing the input into its components.
- Index Calculation: Calculate the task index as (urgency + necessity) / (cost + duration).
- Sorted Task Display: Display tasks in a sortable list, sorted by index in descending order.
- Task Completion: Provide a visual indicator (e.g., checkbox) to mark tasks as completed.

- Accent: Teal (#008080) to highlight important actions and the task index.
- Clean, sans-serif typography for clear readability.
